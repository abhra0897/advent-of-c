## Advent of C

I came to know about [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in 2023 for the first time.

Here I am uploading my AoC solutions written in plain C, the language of the God. I don't think I can solve all the challenges. I'm doing this in my spare time.

My progress so far:

| Year | Day               | Part    |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| 2023 | [01](2023/day01)  | 1 and 2 |
|      | [02](2023/day02)  | 1 and 2 |
|      | [03](2023/day03)  | 1       |
